# Album Tracker MVC README
## Welcome to Album Tracker MVC.

### This MVC is designed for the serious record collector who wants to keep track of their album collection. Let's say the collection has 1,000 albums on vinyl records. How does one keep track of that many records and what's on them and who released them, and what year? Simple. With Album Tracker!

## What Album Tracker is and how it works

### From the Home page, the user can search for an album, an album artist (Say a band, a duo, an orchestra, or a solo music artist) or an individual song. The latter can be used to find a song whose album it camme from and/or who recorded it. So there are pages for the Albums, Album Artists, and Songs and users of Album Tracker MVC can find what they need to know on one of those pages.

### For example, let's say someone wanted to know how many versions of "Stairway To Heaven" they have in their albun collection. So they would go to the "Songs" page and look up "Stairway to Heaven" and might find versions by Led Zeppelin, Dolly Parton, or even some obscure local band.

### Another use for Album Tracker is to look up what albums from an artist they may have. It can be done by clicking on the Artists page.

### It is also possible for Album Tracker users to input information about a new record they just bought by entering the album and artists on the Album page.
