# Album Tracker MVC README
## Welcome to Album Tracker MVC.

### This MVC is designed for the serious record collector who wants to keep track of their album collection. Let's say the collection has 1,000 albums on vinyl records. How does one keep track of that many records and what's on them and who released them, and what year? Simple. With Album Tracker!
